### Project description:

My project is a real estate company website developed to showcase available properties and provide information about the company's services. The website includes sections for home, about, designs, showrooms, and contacts.

    ### Home:
    Provides an introduction to the real estate agency, welcoming visitors and outlining the services offered.

    About: Offers information about the company's background, mission, and values, emphasizing its commitment to exceptional service and professionalism.

    Designs: Showcases interior designs of houses and provides an overview of the real estate market.

    Showrooms: Displays available mansionettes with details such as area, price, and description. Users can also purchase properties directly from the website.

    Contacts: Provides contact information for the company, including phone numbers, email addresses, and social media links.

The website features responsive design, making it accessible across various devices, and utilizes technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome. It fetches mansionette data from a JSON API and dynamically renders it on the webpage. Additionally, users can interact with the website to search for properties and view detailed information about each listing.
